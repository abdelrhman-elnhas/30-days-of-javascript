      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const players3 = players.slice();

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const players4 = [].concat(players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 22, age: 15 });
      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
